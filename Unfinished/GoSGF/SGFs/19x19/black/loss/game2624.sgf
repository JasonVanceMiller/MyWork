C[HenryAdams1838: good move
HenryAdams1838: I almost missed that
WolV: thanks
WolV: I am forsure dead though
WolV: I think it is gg
HenryAdams1838: well, that one group
HenryAdams1838: but it doesn't mean much
HenryAdams1838: I'm finding that this is nothing like chess
WolV: I disagree
WolV: so I love competitive gmaes
WolV: and I find that any game after a mess up is irrelevant 
WolV: because you are learning on a faulty playing field
HenryAdams1838: but if you never play lost positions, how will you get good at them?
HenryAdams1838: and end games?
WolV: my problem right now is micro not macro focused
WolV: when I am good at micro then I can worry about macro
HenryAdams1838: hmm, makes sense
WolV: but the worst thing I could do to myself at this point 
HenryAdams1838: honestly, I think the same is true for me
HenryAdams1838: I cannot read the board
WolV: The worst thing I could do
WolV: is make bad micro the norm
WolV: because then I will try to make choices on my bad micro
HenryAdams1838: well, you've thought it all out, so who would I be to disagree?
WolV: but you are a right to disagree
HenryAdams1838: we could always play again in the time
WolV: lets rematch
HenryAdams1838: okay
