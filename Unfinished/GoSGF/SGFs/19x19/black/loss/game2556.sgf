C[DCircle: You really need to stop doing this... The standard Joseki answer to 2-4 is 3-3, just so you know ;)

C[DCircle: Tbh I had a look at the most common joseki here in the puzzle section

C[DCircle: Didn't really learn them by heart, but this one is just the most common. Happens at least in every second game

C[DCircle: Ofc you don't always have to play joseki ;) Sometimes it's a good think to play somethign else

C[WolV: did I play this area well?

C[DCircle: After move 116 you should've played J15 to not let me enter that area and decrease your territory

C[DCircle: I'm not experienced enough to tell how many points you lost by letting me cut you
WolV: yeah
]
(;B[nn]
C[DCircle: Now you got a lot of stones more or less wasted in the top area which don't make any territory
]

C[WolV: but I got a few captures

C[WolV: doesn't that about even it out
DCircle: No definitely not
DCircle: The difference in territory you lost and territory I won is way bigger than maybe 1 or 2 captures
DCircle: Plus I got mor captures than you atm ;)

C[WolV: but I am not basing my analysis on having the 100+ territory of the entire top right

C[WolV: I am just trying to get a good chunk
DCircle: You could have had a good chunk between the H and N column

C[WolV: but it also helped get the 12-5 chunk
