C[WolV: well played
Mants: thanks
WolV: any tips for a new player
Mants: just play as much as possible and try correspondence games
WolV: what are correspondence games
Mants: you can spend time and search josekis and learn how to apply them
Mants: not live games. you have days in total to play
Mants: you can play a few moves, then one person decides he has some stuff to do and you continue later
Mants: usually i play with 3 day initial time with +1 day / move up to 5 days
WolV: that is pretty interesting
WolV: I might give that a go
WolV: see
WolV: that was a joke
WolV: gg
Mants: ^^
Mants: let me know if you want to play again
Mants: anyway, good night
