C[WolV: Hey buddy
WolV: I have a idea
WolV: how about we play a game
WolV: but we plan out all of our variations in a review
WolV: so when the game is all over
WolV: we can both learn from all of the variations that we as individuals missed
WolV: \[object Object\]
WolV: I just did the first move for a guide
Yuki-Usa: hi, that a interesting idea, how about we do this just for some important moves or if the other asks for it. couse 200 comments would be insane at the end of the game xD
WolV: that is fine with me
Yuki-Usa: \[object Object\]
WolV: you don't have to keep posting the review
WolV: it refreshes

WolV: hold up

C[Yuki-Usa: and i can`t write anything in your review
WolV: ok

(;W[dd]
C[WolV: here is my understanding of the review
WolV: there is a owner of the review
WolV: and they are the only person who can play variations or draw
WolV: so my review I can put comments
WolV: but you can view
WolV: and your variation
WolV: you can comment 
WolV: and I can view
WolV: do you follow
WolV: we will just have to run two reviews
WolV: which is fine
Yuki-Usa: i see
Yuki-Usa: well so far it`s just basic stuff ^^
Yuki-Usa: well we could just discuss interesting moves and variations in the game chatt we don`t realy need the review

(;B[fq]
C[WolV: sure
WolV: but I still am going to document my moves
WolV: it is something I have wanted to do for a while
Yuki-Usa: that`s a good way of learning i like it

C[WolV: It is really nice that I am forcing myself to explain my moves
WolV: because normally I play on instinct 
WolV: but if I have to write something down then it makes it more logical
Yuki-Usa: can u read move 8?
WolV: in your review yes

(;W[lq]
C[Yuki-Usa: hm didn`t expect ur kosumi at this point
]
(;B[pj]
C[WolV: It is joseki
WolV: and I like the followup 
Yuki-Usa: its shusakus kosumi but i don`t know this followup
WolV: I think it is normally closer
WolV: but it is a strong extension off of a strong shape so I am fine with playing a bit far away 
WolV: and it is 4th line so I don't feel bad about connecting underneath 
Yuki-Usa: move 5 is just right couse its on the wider side
WolV: if you read through my review
WolV: I played out a lot of joseki variations
WolV: before you played 3,5
WolV: and they all played into this

C[WolV: can you see all of the variations I put in my review
Yuki-Usa: at least i see a lot of ^^
