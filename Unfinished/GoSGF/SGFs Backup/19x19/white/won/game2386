C[ginefree: thx
WolV: you are a very strong player
WolV: with skills that are comparable to mine 
WolV: but there is one flaw that is easy to work on
WolV: the direction of play
WolV: people have different ideas of what go is
WolV: a surrounding game
WolV: a game of war
WolV: I believe that it is a game of negotiation 
WolV: in every fight both players are trying to get the most that they can
WolV: and often it is very peaceful
WolV: when you negotiate fights
WolV: you choose a direction that is beneficial for me 
WolV: I am trying to find a example
WolV: move 37
WolV: you atari to give me strength 
WolV: it was basically a free move for me
WolV: just something to keep in mind
ginefree: thanks
