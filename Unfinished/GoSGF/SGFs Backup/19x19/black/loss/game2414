C[WolV: this is where I frantically learn how to read
turix: :-)
turix: well, you already taught me not to get too self-confident.  you did a nice job with your H16 invasion.
WolV: thanks
WolV: I am pretty sure it is all ogre
WolV: gg
turix: yeah, although I can't claim to know for sure, but the liberties are now very tight on that H8 group.
WolV: I read it all out
turix: good game.  I really got nervious when you came in from the top.
WolV: there is no saving it
WolV: thanks
WolV: you played very well too
turix: thanks
turix: (I was inspired by watching AlphaGo games to try to play in the centre more.  Lol.)
