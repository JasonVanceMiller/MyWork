C[NAMDOOG yerffeJ: didn't expect that cut
WolV: yeah
WolV: I didn't read out n11
WolV: that might be gg
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: not sure how over
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: big lead for me though
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: gg
WolV: gg
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: about equal in territory
WolV: the purpose of the pincer was to make both of your walls worthless
WolV: but the capture of the 4 stones makes the 2 walls work 
WolV: with only a small group in the middle
WolV: I need more otherwise it is over
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: yeah
WolV: keep in mind this was my half of the board
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: but we're double digit k
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: big comebacks can happen :)
WolV: nah dude
WolV: I don't care about the win
WolV: have you ever done a stats class
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: yes
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: stats major in college actually
WolV: damn
WolV: I am taking the ap right now 
WolV: but if I try to make any evaluation based on this game after the 4 stones are captured 
WolV: the results would be inaccurate because I am measuring victory 
WolV: but the victory is already less probable 
WolV: my starting a new game it prevents confounding by current position 
WolV: right 
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: sure, the act of evaluating doesn't change the probability though
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: probability would be quite low but there's still open areas on the left
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: maybe 10% in an even game at 15k? 1% at 2k?
WolV: yeah 
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: above that stronger player won't lose
WolV: but if I preform a good sequence on a even board then the win rate will reflect that more accurately than on a losing board
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: yes
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: you beat me in a couple joseki from here you're still low prob
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: but in new game it goes up significantly
WolV: true true
WolV: we are all students of the game
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: yes indeed
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: and stats apparently
WolV: lol
WolV: stats is pretty interesting 
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: a lot of people have trouble looking at it the right way
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: once you do the intro stuff really isn't hard
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: but developing that intuition and change in mindset can be quite challenging
WolV: yeah
WolV: all math is super cool to me
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: I agree, and physics. It's a shame people get overwhelmed by it
WolV: yeah
WolV: welp
WolV: good luck with your games buddy
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: physics is often taught in too complicated a manner
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: yeah you too. and with the stats
NAMDOOG yerffeJ: thanks for the game
