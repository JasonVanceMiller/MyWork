This is a collection of projects that I am satisfied with but are unfinished. 

SmashList:

I am a fan of the video game Super Smash Bros Ultimate. A big part of the Smash community is to ranks and debate the power levels of the 80ish playable characters that the game has to offer. The way that this was done on the forums was a poll asking which character people felt was strongest, with 80 options, one for each character. 

As someone who has a interest in statistics, this was a bit aggravating for me. I wanted to make a website that could implement a elo system by having people compare pairs of characters for a more accurate system. I had messaged a moderator of the forums to see if they were interested, and had finished the front end before they responded. They said that they were happy with the system that they had, so I ended up abandoning this project.  


NeuralNet:

For the longest time I have been fascinated by machine learning. Starting in around 11th grade I had made a plan for a big project. I was going to build the software that constructs neural networks from scratch. Then I was going to use that code to train a bot to play the Chinese board game Go. Then I would use that bot to improve my own play. 

This project was EXTREMELY ambitious. I was basically attempting to do what a team of Google researchers did by myself. I ended up breaking down the project into smaller steps.  I was going to try to make a basic neural net. I would use other neural net software to train a bot. Then I would improve my Go play with a existing bot.

Every few years I would revisit this problem and apply what I learned form my classes. This is the version that I made after taking vector calculus and linear algebra, and actually had enough math to understand what to do. It isn't good. This network has major issues with data sets beyond two data points, but I was able to make a proof of concept. I am very happy with the process that I went through with this project and I better understand machine learning because of it.
