Here are the descriptions of projects I have finished. 

ChickenNuggetProblem: 
	
This was a interesting coding challenge that me and my dad went back and forth on during a trip to the beach. The problem is that given a set of quantities that a company can produce ie 5 and 12 find the largest number that a customer can order that can't be satisfied. In this case the largest is 31.

The challenge that my dad and I went back and forth over was if there was a way to program this faster than a brute force check.
